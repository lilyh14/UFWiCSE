# UFWiCSE
UF Women in Computer Science and Engineering (UF WiCSE), is the official student ACM-W chapter at the University of Florida. This is the source code for its website, which is live at [https://www.cise.ufl.edu/dept/ufwicse/](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/dept/ufwicse/)

As a computer science club, UF WiCSE needed a responsive, modern, and clean website. This project aims to provide that. Due to hosting constraints, we are only able to host static pages, but we still strive to keep it up-to-date using the latest tools and frameworks.
